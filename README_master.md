Team Basti-Marcel-Gabi-Fabi

-------------------------------------
this is the master branch. All up to date files should be here.
-------------------------------------
There are until now 3 types of places in this project:
-resources
-workspace
-description
-------------------------------------
When you upload a file, please do it from the folder in which that file belongs. This is valid also for compressed files.
Please make a new branch each time you want to modify smth. This allows others to work on the same file in the same time. Dont worry about conflicts, because thats the role of github. After you finish, make a pull request and if everything is ok, merge the branch with the master and delete the non-master branch.

Is recommended to download the github desktop app, which allows the project/branch to be downloaded on your computer, thus make it easier to work on it. After the modifications, just push and commit from the app or cmd, if u have installed the git library.
