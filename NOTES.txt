Reccomendation: test implementation with intermeditate steps

parametrize SP0, SP1 which is given in the skeleton
comment out initialisations of interrupts and edma
just test golden wire with SP0, SP1 and ADC

next add interrupts by making CPU respond to McBSP interrupts to test them
just read the value and write it out

last step, add the param of the EDMA


NOTE: when you download your program (DEBUG)
Menu - Tools - Graph
-> graphical display of a vector:
-length of data (BuffIN BuffOUT)
-data type (16b signed int)
-start address of the data (the name of the array, cause in C the names of arrays are addr)

suggestion: make a break point to view the data
ADC and DAC are stereo -> 2 ch
